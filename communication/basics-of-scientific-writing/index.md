Basics of scientific writing
============================

This was a 1.5 hour-long seminar on scientific writing for research papers, at MIT, on October 7th, 2015.

 * Take whatever opportunity yo can get to write, especially if you can get feedback and revise your writing. 
   + It's really the revising that is the most instructive.

General comments about scientific writing
-----------------------------------------

 * _Scientific writing:_ Precise, concise, object report of research
 * Old habits die hard
   + start at 2am, finish by 9am deadline
   + use scholarly / serious / smart language
   + meet the page count
 * New habits
   + write a first draft early
   + get feedback
   + revise it more than once
   + Use easy to understand language (suits your content)
   + Write to communicate!
 * How to get started on writing?
   + Model your writing after someone in your field who is especially good
   + Read texts on scientific writing
     - "The craft of scientific writing", by Michael Alley
     - "How to write and publish a scientific paper", by Robert A. Day
     - "Technical and scientific writing", by Leslie C. Prelman
          - Not exactly the best book on sci. writ. but is searchable
 * Aim your writing to form a story; a coherent, flowing, logical story
   + This tends to stick in people's heads
 * Plan. Give your writing **thought** and **time**
 * Make outlines.
   + Every good artist will develop a draft for his work
   + Try out various ways of laying out your paper
   + Forces you to establish the scope of your document
   + Forces you to develop a point of view.
   + Get feedback on your outline. Provide headins/table of contents and **topic sentences** for your paper
     - Topic sentences are **very important** in western writing.
     - If you get the topic sentences from papers in journals like Science, you end up with the outline of the paper.
 * Revise, revise; at any point.
 * Edit/Polish
   - Don't be afraid to edit severely.
   - Average # of drafts for scientific papers is 23!
   - Making sure paragraphs have one simple idea.
 * Get feedback on your writing and provide feedback on their writing.
   - Constructiveness is important, otherwise people don't listen to the advice.
   - Ability to accept feedback is important. You are not a victim of injustice.
 * Three aspects of writing style
   - Structure: organization, emphasis, transition, depth
   - Language: precision, clarity, forthrightness (go around the point or directly to it), fluidity, conciseness (the use of the fewest possible words to do your writing)

### Structure

 > Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over. -- Ernest Hemingway

 - The structure is what holds it all together.
 - Don't get too fancy or too flowery
 - Try to make it as simple and as direct as possible
 - Organization is reflected in headings, subheadings and topic sentences
   + Think about how you read papers (in what order)
   + Think about how your reader might want to read your paper
   + What's the right granularity?
 - Sometimes you need subheadings.
 - The paragraph should be _the unit of composition_: one paragraph for each major idea.
   + This helps the reader: they know new paragraph means new topic.
   + Do not write single sentences as paragraphs.
 - Transitions link ideas.
 - Common flaw is poor logical flow, bad transitions.
 - Transition are often at the beginning of the sentence
 - Sometimes transitions are used at the beginning of the paragraph
 - Type of transitions:
   + consequences; cause and effect
   + contrast
   + sequence and connectivity
   + similarity and comparisons
   + explanations
 * Write with the reader in mind.
   + readers don't just read; they interpret.
   + your problem for not giving reader information where they expected
   + Recommended reading: Gopen and Swan, "Science of scientific writing"
 * If you are reading a sentence aloud and you have to stop and take a breath, then it's too long.
 * If the subject is separated from the verb by too many words, it's bad.
 * The reader tends to wait for the verb to come and will go back to the subject, if you had a huge gap between them.
 * Standard word positioning is: Subj + Verb + Obj

### Language

 * Scientific language avoids needless complexity
 * Firstly, secondly and thirdly -> First, second and third
 * Drop needless words
   + Already existing
   + Basic fundamentals
   + Completely eliminate
   + Empty space
   + Had done previously
   + Introduced 
   + Mix together (can't mix apart)
   + Never before
   + In order to (just use 'to', but occasionally the rhythm of the sentence needs 'in order to')
 * Weak vs. strong verbs
   + Made the arrangement for vs arranged
   + Made the decision vs decided
   + Made the measurement vs measured
   + (Known as nominalizing the verb => verb becomes very weak)
     - Really, stay away from "made"
   + Keep the action in the verb! Makes the sentence stronger!
 * Don't use the passive voice 
   + Bio papers before 1950 used passive voice and were much harder to understand
   + In 1953 a classic paper was published that changed the writing style
   + _Chris:_ "If you can add _'by zombies'_ at the end of your sentence, then you're using the passive voice."
     - "The object was moved (by zombies)." vs. "We moved the object."
   + The "Watson and Creek" paper
     - Google "rhetorical analysis of Watson and Creek paper"
     - The answer will be they changed writing by using active voice.
     - They used active voice to talk about their work and passive voice to talk about other's work
         - "We've shown X", "It was shown by Y that W is true"
   + "The oscilloscope displayed the voltage" vs "The voltage was displayed by the oscilloscope" 
   + Not always possible to use active voice.
   + Try to keep it active voice, unless it gets boring. Must use passive voice too at certain points.
     - Q: Not clear how to alternate the voices?
 * Correct word usage
   + Priciple vs. principal
   + Affect vs. effect
   + Alternative vs. alternate
   + Use a dictionary otherwise
 * "Vigorous writing is concise"
   + The elements of style, by Strunk and White
   + Every word must be the right word, relate to its neighbor
 * Write a story
 * Use of abbreviations
   + i.e. -- that is (id est)
   + e.g. -- for example (exempli gratia)"
   + et al. -- and others (et alii)
 * Spell checking
   + Will not always work "Roses smell sweet/sweat."


### Illustration

Writing a research paper
------------------------

 * Hourglas diagram/model of Hill et al.
 * Introduction is a trapezoid that gets narrower towards the end
   - It means you start out with a broad statement about your field
   - You want to bring the reader into your world; called _the hook_
   - the rest of the introduction is a focused discussion of the literature
   - the end talks about how your project will fill the gap in the literature
 * Methods section
 * Discussion section is a trapezoid that gets wider towards the end
   - begins with short summary of the results
   - rest is discussion of literature, except now you're saying "this is how my results address and extend our knowledge of what's already out there"
   - the end: why does this matter to the world
 * Q: In Computer Science the organization differs
   - Intro presents problem, quick results and contributions and why it matters

### Introduction

 * A method to familiarize and orient
 * Content depends on purpose of paper and the audience 
 * Written largely in the present tense
   + Could still have "X et al. _showed_ that protein X _is_ translocated to the nucleus"
 * What's accepted in the field is in present
 * Context: Orient your reader to the literature
 * Focus: What questions are you addressing? What's your hypothesis.
 * Justification: Show your work fits into and extends current work
 * Common pitfalls: 
   + Including unnecessary background, keep it focused (to what?)
   + Exaggerating or understating the importance of your work
   + Using lackluster openers (topic sentences must be strong) and weak follow-through in the body of your intro.
   + Including new results. (Q: In CS, contributions are stated in intro)
   + Improper tense (introduction is largely present tense)

### Methods

 * Describe the tools and processes
 * Readers basically check your work in this section
 * Pitfalls:
   + Providing too little or too much inforamtion
   + Reiterating published work rather than citing them
   + Writing strictly in chronological order
     - Most important first
     - Most fundamental first
   + Writing a _protocol_ instead of a methods section
     - i.e. don't just write step by step what you did and nothing else
   + Putting too much detail in about stuff people in your field already know
     - e.g. like PK impersonation attacks?
 * Usually written in past tense

### Results
 
 * Don't have a paper without results section
 * Begin with an overview of the experimental design and stating the main findings to:
   - orient the reader
   - give the reader a sense of scope
 * Report data in a logical order
 * Results are primarily in the past tense

### Discussion

This where you:

 * Summarize findings
 * Cite supporting literature
 * Explain discrepancies between your work and prevent
   + Must emphasize what's new in your work
 * You should point out shortcomings of your own work, not others, in this section.
 * Define unsettled points.
 * Discuss theoretical and practical implications of your work
 * Why does this matter to the world.
 * What did you expect to find and why?
 * Don't be tempted by the squid technique: don't use ink just to obscure, make your words count
 * What makes discussion tough?
   - Hard to define, requires perspective, knowledge, read the literature, 
   - May have started before conclusions were formulated
   - May follow weak or inconclusive data
 * Pitfalls:
   - Long wordy arguments that lack focus; lots of speculation
   - Failure to follow through with arguments from intro
   - Hedging excessively: wanna say something but you're not very sure of it
     + One hedging word per sentence like may/possibly/presumable/etc!
 * Primarily written in present tense

### Reference citations

### The abstract and the title

Abstract

 * "To abstract is to take away or remove the most important data from a set of records.", so it has to happen at the end.
 * About 250 words
 * Every abstract has a intro, methods, results, discussion and conclusion.
 * Pitfalls:
   + All information in abstract needs to be in paper (no extra info)
   + Research paper abstracts are different than review papers
   + No abbreviations that are not described (unless DNA, RNA)
   + No scientific jargon? (Q: Whattt??)'
   + No references, no citations
   + Failure to state purpose

Titles

 * Use minimal of technical terminology
 * Use fewer than 80 characters
 * Avoid active verbs, numerical values, abbreviations and punctuation
 * No period at the end of the title
 * Bad titles
   + Too wide
   + Too long
   + Ambiguity due to gerunds
   + Too general
   + Too specific
   + Too short
   + Incomprehensible

Always keep your reader in mind!
