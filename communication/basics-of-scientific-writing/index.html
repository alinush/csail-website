<h1>Basics of scientific writing</h1>

<p>This was a 1.5 hour-long seminar on scientific writing for research papers, at MIT, on October 7th, 2015.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take whatever opportunity yo can get to write, especially if you can get feedback and revise your writing. 
<ul>
<li>It's really the revising that is the most instructive.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>General comments about scientific writing</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Scientific writing:</em> Precise, concise, object report of research</li>
<li>Old habits die hard
<ul>
<li>start at 2am, finish by 9am deadline</li>
<li>use scholarly / serious / smart language</li>
<li>meet the page count</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New habits
<ul>
<li>write a first draft early</li>
<li>get feedback</li>
<li>revise it more than once</li>
<li>Use easy to understand language (suits your content)</li>
<li>Write to communicate!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to get started on writing?
<ul>
<li>Model your writing after someone in your field who is especially good</li>
<li>Read texts on scientific writing
<ul>
<li>"The craft of scientific writing", by Michael Alley</li>
<li>"How to write and publish a scientific paper", by Robert A. Day</li>
<li>"Technical and scientific writing", by Leslie C. Prelman
<ul>
<li>Not exactly the best book on sci. writ. but is searchable</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aim your writing to form a story; a coherent, flowing, logical story
<ul>
<li>This tends to stick in people's heads</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Plan. Give your writing <strong>thought</strong> and <strong>time</strong></li>
<li>Make outlines.
<ul>
<li>Every good artist will develop a draft for his work</li>
<li>Try out various ways of laying out your paper</li>
<li>Forces you to establish the scope of your document</li>
<li>Forces you to develop a point of view.</li>
<li>Get feedback on your outline. Provide headins/table of contents and <strong>topic sentences</strong> for your paper
<ul>
<li>Topic sentences are <strong>very important</strong> in western writing.</li>
<li>If you get the topic sentences from papers in journals like Science, you end up with the outline of the paper.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Revise, revise; at any point.</li>
<li>Edit/Polish
<ul>
<li>Don't be afraid to edit severely.</li>
<li>Average # of drafts for scientific papers is 23!</li>
<li>Making sure paragraphs have one simple idea.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get feedback on your writing and provide feedback on their writing.
<ul>
<li>Constructiveness is important, otherwise people don't listen to the advice.</li>
<li>Ability to accept feedback is important. You are not a victim of injustice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Three aspects of writing style
<ul>
<li>Structure: organization, emphasis, transition, depth</li>
<li>Language: precision, clarity, forthrightness (go around the point or directly to it), fluidity, conciseness (the use of the fewest possible words to do your writing)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over. -- Ernest Hemingway</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The structure is what holds it all together.</li>
<li>Don't get too fancy or too flowery</li>
<li>Try to make it as simple and as direct as possible</li>
<li>Organization is reflected in headings, subheadings and topic sentences
<ul>
<li>Think about how you read papers (in what order)</li>
<li>Think about how your reader might want to read your paper</li>
<li>What's the right granularity?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometimes you need subheadings.</li>
<li>The paragraph should be <em>the unit of composition</em>: one paragraph for each major idea.
<ul>
<li>This helps the reader: they know new paragraph means new topic.</li>
<li>Do not write single sentences as paragraphs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transitions link ideas.</li>
<li>Common flaw is poor logical flow, bad transitions.</li>
<li>Transition are often at the beginning of the sentence</li>
<li>Sometimes transitions are used at the beginning of the paragraph</li>
<li>Type of transitions:
<ul>
<li>consequences; cause and effect</li>
<li>contrast</li>
<li>sequence and connectivity</li>
<li>similarity and comparisons</li>
<li>explanations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write with the reader in mind.
<ul>
<li>readers don't just read; they interpret.</li>
<li>your problem for not giving reader information where they expected</li>
<li>Recommended reading: Gopen and Swan, "Science of scientific writing"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are reading a sentence aloud and you have to stop and take a breath, then it's too long.</li>
<li>If the subject is separated from the verb by too many words, it's bad.</li>
<li>The reader tends to wait for the verb to come and will go back to the subject, if you had a huge gap between them.</li>
<li>Standard word positioning is: Subj + Verb + Obj</li>
</ul>

<h3>Language</h3>

<ul>
<li>Scientific language avoids needless complexity</li>
<li>Firstly, secondly and thirdly -> First, second and third</li>
<li>Drop needless words
<ul>
<li>Already existing</li>
<li>Basic fundamentals</li>
<li>Completely eliminate</li>
<li>Empty space</li>
<li>Had done previously</li>
<li>Introduced </li>
<li>Mix together (can't mix apart)</li>
<li>Never before</li>
<li>In order to (just use 'to', but occasionally the rhythm of the sentence needs 'in order to')</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Weak vs. strong verbs
<ul>
<li>Made the arrangement for vs arranged</li>
<li>Made the decision vs decided</li>
<li>Made the measurement vs measured</li>
<li>(Known as nominalizing the verb => verb becomes very weak)
<ul>
<li>Really, stay away from "made"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep the action in the verb! Makes the sentence stronger!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't use the passive voice 
<ul>
<li>Bio papers before 1950 used passive voice and were much harder to understand</li>
<li>In 1953 a classic paper was published that changed the writing style</li>
<li><em>Chris:</em> "If you can add <em>'by zombies'</em> at the end of your sentence, then you're using the passive voice."
<ul>
<li>"The object was moved (by zombies)." vs. "We moved the object."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The "Watson and Creek" paper
<ul>
<li>Google "rhetorical analysis of Watson and Creek paper"</li>
<li>The answer will be they changed writing by using active voice.</li>
<li>They used active voice to talk about their work and passive voice to talk about other's work
<ul>
<li>"We've shown X", "It was shown by Y that W is true"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>"The oscilloscope displayed the voltage" vs "The voltage was displayed by the oscilloscope" </li>
<li>Not always possible to use active voice.</li>
<li>Try to keep it active voice, unless it gets boring. Must use passive voice too at certain points.
<ul>
<li>Q: Not clear how to alternate the voices?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Correct word usage
<ul>
<li>Priciple vs. principal</li>
<li>Affect vs. effect</li>
<li>Alternative vs. alternate</li>
<li>Use a dictionary otherwise</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Vigorous writing is concise"
<ul>
<li>The elements of style, by Strunk and White</li>
<li>Every word must be the right word, relate to its neighbor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write a story</li>
<li>Use of abbreviations
<ul>
<li>i.e. -- that is (id est)</li>
<li>e.g. -- for example (exempli gratia)"</li>
<li>et al. -- and others (et alii)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spell checking
<ul>
<li>Will not always work "Roses smell sweet/sweat."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Illustration</h3>

<h2>Writing a research paper</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hourglas diagram/model of Hill et al.</li>
<li>Introduction is a trapezoid that gets narrower towards the end
<ul>
<li>It means you start out with a broad statement about your field</li>
<li>You want to bring the reader into your world; called <em>the hook</em></li>
<li>the rest of the introduction is a focused discussion of the literature</li>
<li>the end talks about how your project will fill the gap in the literature</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Methods section</li>
<li>Discussion section is a trapezoid that gets wider towards the end
<ul>
<li>begins with short summary of the results</li>
<li>rest is discussion of literature, except now you're saying "this is how my results address and extend our knowledge of what's already out there"</li>
<li>the end: why does this matter to the world</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q: In Computer Science the organization differs
<ul>
<li>Intro presents problem, quick results and contributions and why it matters</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<ul>
<li>A method to familiarize and orient</li>
<li>Content depends on purpose of paper and the audience </li>
<li>Written largely in the present tense
<ul>
<li>Could still have "X et al. <em>showed</em> that protein X <em>is</em> translocated to the nucleus"</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What's accepted in the field is in present</li>
<li>Context: Orient your reader to the literature</li>
<li>Focus: What questions are you addressing? What's your hypothesis.</li>
<li>Justification: Show your work fits into and extends current work</li>
<li>Common pitfalls: 
<ul>
<li>Including unnecessary background, keep it focused (to what?)</li>
<li>Exaggerating or understating the importance of your work</li>
<li>Using lackluster openers (topic sentences must be strong) and weak follow-through in the body of your intro.</li>
<li>Including new results. (Q: In CS, contributions are stated in intro)</li>
<li>Improper tense (introduction is largely present tense)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<ul>
<li>Describe the tools and processes</li>
<li>Readers basically check your work in this section</li>
<li>Pitfalls:
<ul>
<li>Providing too little or too much inforamtion</li>
<li>Reiterating published work rather than citing them</li>
<li>Writing strictly in chronological order
<ul>
<li>Most important first</li>
<li>Most fundamental first</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Writing a <em>protocol</em> instead of a methods section
<ul>
<li>i.e. don't just write step by step what you did and nothing else</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Putting too much detail in about stuff people in your field already know
<ul>
<li>e.g. like PK impersonation attacks?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Usually written in past tense</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don't have a paper without results section</li>
<li>Begin with an overview of the experimental design and stating the main findings to:
<ul>
<li>orient the reader</li>
<li>give the reader a sense of scope</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Report data in a logical order</li>
<li>Results are primarily in the past tense</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>This where you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Summarize findings</li>
<li>Cite supporting literature</li>
<li>Explain discrepancies between your work and prevent
<ul>
<li>Must emphasize what's new in your work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You should point out shortcomings of your own work, not others, in this section.</li>
<li>Define unsettled points.</li>
<li>Discuss theoretical and practical implications of your work</li>
<li>Why does this matter to the world.</li>
<li>What did you expect to find and why?</li>
<li>Don't be tempted by the squid technique: don't use ink just to obscure, make your words count</li>
<li>What makes discussion tough?
<ul>
<li>Hard to define, requires perspective, knowledge, read the literature, </li>
<li>May have started before conclusions were formulated</li>
<li>May follow weak or inconclusive data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pitfalls:
<ul>
<li>Long wordy arguments that lack focus; lots of speculation</li>
<li>Failure to follow through with arguments from intro</li>
<li>Hedging excessively: wanna say something but you're not very sure of it
<ul>
<li>One hedging word per sentence like may/possibly/presumable/etc!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Primarily written in present tense</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reference citations</h3>

<h3>The abstract and the title</h3>

<p>Abstract</p>

<ul>
<li>"To abstract is to take away or remove the most important data from a set of records.", so it has to happen at the end.</li>
<li>About 250 words</li>
<li>Every abstract has a intro, methods, results, discussion and conclusion.</li>
<li>Pitfalls:
<ul>
<li>All information in abstract needs to be in paper (no extra info)</li>
<li>Research paper abstracts are different than review papers</li>
<li>No abbreviations that are not described (unless DNA, RNA)</li>
<li>No scientific jargon? (Q: Whattt??)'</li>
<li>No references, no citations</li>
<li>Failure to state purpose</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Titles</p>

<ul>
<li>Use minimal of technical terminology</li>
<li>Use fewer than 80 characters</li>
<li>Avoid active verbs, numerical values, abbreviations and punctuation</li>
<li>No period at the end of the title</li>
<li>Bad titles
<ul>
<li>Too wide</li>
<li>Too long</li>
<li>Ambiguity due to gerunds</li>
<li>Too general</li>
<li>Too specific</li>
<li>Too short</li>
