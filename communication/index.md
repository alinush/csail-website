My own notes:

 * [Basics of Scientific Writing](basics-of-scientific-writing/), at MIT on Oct. 7th, 2015

**Stuff to remember:**
 
 * **Desire and belief:** You must _want_ to produce good writing. You must _believe_ you can produce good writing.
 * **Purpose** of writing is to convey _an idea_
 * **Start by writing** about your idea, it'll help you further refine it and understand it yourself
 * **Topic sentences** are important. A reader should get the outline of your paper by simply reading the topic sentences in each paragraph.
 * **The rule of three:**
   - tell them what you will tell them
   - tell them
   - tell them what you have told them (but do not repeat the introduction, instead add value by highlighting and discussing)
 * **Recurse:** _the rule of three_ applies at all levels
   - first and last sentence of a paragraph must introduce and summarise its content/argument
   - first and last paragraph in a (sub)section will introduce and summarise it
   - first and last sections of a chapter will introduce and summarise it
   - first and last chapters introduce and summarise the entire paper/dissertation
   - your writing should make (some?) sense even if you just read 
     + the first sentence in every paragraph in a section
     + the first paragraph in every section
     + the first section of every chapter
 * **Prize winning stuff:** If you're _shy_ about editing your writing or deleting a lot of it and rewriting it, have a `PRIZE-WINNING-STUFF.txt` file where you can cut and paste all of the text you are shy about deleting.
