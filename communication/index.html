<p><strong>Stuff to remember:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Desire and belief:</strong> You must <em>want</em> to produce good writing. You must <em>believe</em> you can produce good writing.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong> of writing is to convey <em>an idea</em></li>
<li><strong>Start by writing</strong> about your idea, it'll help you further refine it and understand it yourself</li>
<li><strong>Topic sentences</strong> are important. A reader should get the outline of your paper by simply reading the topic sentences in each paragraph.</li>
<li><strong>The rule of three:</strong>
<ul>
<li>tell them what you will tell them</li>
<li>tell them</li>
<li>tell them what you have told them (but do not repeat the introduction, instead add value by highlighting and discussing)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recurse:</strong> <em>the rule of three</em> applies at all levels
<ul>
<li>first and last sentence of a paragraph must introduce and summarise its content/argument</li>
<li>first and last paragraph in a (sub)section will introduce and summarise it</li>
<li>first and last sections of a chapter will introduce and summarise it</li>
<li>first and last chapters introduce and summarise the entire paper/dissertation</li>
<li>your writing should make (some?) sense even if you just read 
<ul>
<li>the first sentence in every paragraph in a section</li>
<li>the first paragraph in every section</li>
<li>the first section of every chapter</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prize winning stuff:</strong> If you're <em>shy</em> about editing your writing or deleting a lot of it and rewriting it, have a <code>PRIZE-WINNING-STUFF.txt</code> file where you can cut and paste all of the text you are shy about deleting.</li>
</ul>
