<h2>SSH</h2>

<h3>Setting up an SSH tunnel</h3>

<p>Suppose you have a machine at <code>server.com</code> that has a service running on port 3333, but you cannot
access that port on <code>server.com</code> due to a firewall.</p>

<p>You can <em>forward</em> that port to a local port 9999 on your machine, if you can SSH into <code>server.com</code></p>

<pre><code>ssh -f -N -L 9999:127.0.0.1:3333 user@server.com


-f puts ssh in background
-N makes it not execute a remote command
</code></pre>
