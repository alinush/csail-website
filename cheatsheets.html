<h2>SSH</h2>

<h3>Setting up an SSH tunnel</h3>

<p>Suppose you have a machine at <code>server.com</code> that has a service running on port 3333, but you cannot
access that port on <code>server.com</code> due to a firewall.</p>

<p>You can <em>forward</em> that port to a local port 9999 on your machine, if you can SSH into <code>server.com</code></p>

<pre><code>ssh -f -N -L 9999:127.0.0.1:3333 user@server.com

-f puts ssh in background
-N makes it not execute a remote command
</code></pre>

<p>You can simplify this whole process with a config file.</p>

<pre><code>Host tunnel
    HostName server.com
    # this is optional, if you have a special key for server.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/private.key
    LocalForward 3333 127.0.0.1:9999
    User user
</code></pre>
